# web_spotify_connect
Spotify Connect receiver app. Use a valid Spotify Premium account or it won't work.
# Current features
Connect to the app via any Spotify client (PC, Android, iOS should work too but not tested yet). Music will then be played from the web page (be sure to enable sound output in your browser, some disable it by default).
Playback can be controlled from the app (play/pause, seek).
# Planned upgrade
Explore Spotify library and use the app as a standalone client using Spotify Web API.
